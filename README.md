# PokemonReviewAPI

This is my ASP.NET backend application.  
I created this API for handling the CRUD operations for total of 6 entities.  
I'm using ASP.NET Web API, MicrosoftSQLServer and EntityFramework for this backend.  
I have 2 many-to-many relationships, one is between Pokemon and Owner and the other is between Pokemon and Category.  

Here is my UML diagaram map with all the Entities and Relationships:
